IMPORTANT STEPS BEFORE USING THIS SAMPLE:

In order to use this example correctly, you will need to built the PowerShell DLL to provide the correct 
loading of the Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS link as referred to in the documentation. 

The source for this DLL is included under: %ROOT%/csharp/code/libraries/powershell/Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS

You may either load this in to Visual Studio 2008 / 2010 and build, or you may use the included script as follows:

%ROOT%/csharp/code/libraries/powershell/Microsoft.Samples.Waad.PS/buildWaadPS.bat

It's a simple MSBuild script that will run the default MSBuild with DEBUG configuration and copy the correct .dll in to the \php\
scripts\ directory

Enjoy!
